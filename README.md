**Project Description**

This project implements a k-ary prefix tree (trie) to efficiently map usernames to user IDs. The data structure uses linked lists to store child nodes for each character, ensuring fast insertion, retrieval, and deletion operations. Key features include robust error handling, memory management, and compliance with strict coding standards. The implementation supports various operations, including:

Creating a prefix tree to initialize the structure.
Inserting usernames with unique user IDs.
Retrieving user IDs for given usernames.
Deleting usernames by removing their associated user IDs.
Deallocating the entire tree, freeing all memory.
This trie is designed for performance and scalability, maintaining children in sorted order and ensuring minimal memory overhead. It is suitable for applications requiring efficient prefix-based data storage and retrieval.
